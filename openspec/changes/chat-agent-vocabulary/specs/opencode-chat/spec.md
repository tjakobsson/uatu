## MODIFIED Requirements

### Requirement: The workspace API exposes normalized chat operations
The workspace API SHALL provide authenticated operations to list, create, and read conversations; start a prompt turn; cancel the active turn; answer a pending permission; and answer or reject a structured question. Mutation requests SHALL be origin-protected under cookie authentication, SHALL validate conversation ownership against the workspace directory, and SHALL use client-generated request identifiers to make network retries idempotent. Provider-specific payloads and credentials MUST NOT be exposed as the public contract when a normalized UatuCode representation exists.

The API SHALL report which agent a workspace's Chat is talking to, and which capabilities that agent declares. A capability is declared only when the agent actually supports it; the absence of a declaration SHALL be a normal, expected state rather than an error or an empty result. Consumers SHALL be able to decide what to present from the declaration alone, without probing an operation to discover whether it works.

The API SHALL name a way of working a **mode**, and SHALL name the program Chat talks to an **agent**. These two SHALL NOT share a name in the route table, because they are not the same thing and a reader cannot tell them apart from the route alone.

#### Scenario: Retried prompt does not run twice
- **WHEN** a client retries a prompt mutation with the same request identifier after losing the response
- **THEN** the server returns the original accepted result or current outcome
- **AND** OpenCode receives the prompt at most once

#### Scenario: Cross-origin mutation is rejected
- **WHEN** a cookie-authenticated cross-origin request attempts to prompt, cancel, or answer an agent request
- **THEN** the workspace rejects it without changing the conversation

#### Scenario: Base-path deployment uses relocated chat routes
- **WHEN** Chat is served under a workspace base path such as `/s/project-a/`
- **THEN** every chat request and stream URL resolves through that base path
- **AND** the hub proxies it without exposing the loopback OpenCode service

#### Scenario: The API reports its agent and that agent's capabilities
- **WHEN** a client asks a workspace for its chat status
- **THEN** the response identifies the agent Chat is talking to
- **AND** states which capabilities that agent declares

#### Scenario: An undeclared capability is not an error
- **WHEN** an agent does not declare a capability
- **THEN** the status response omits it rather than reporting a failure
- **AND** the client can tell the difference between "not supported" and "supported but empty"

#### Scenario: Modes are listed under a route named for modes
- **WHEN** a client lists the ways of working a prompt can run under
- **THEN** the route names them modes
- **AND** no route names them agents

### Requirement: Users can prompt, steer, and cancel the active conversation
The Chat composer SHALL submit non-empty text to the selected conversation and clearly distinguish ready, sending, running, interrupted, and failed states. While OpenCode supports steering a running session, a subsequent submitted prompt SHALL be presented as a steer of the active turn rather than an unrelated concurrent turn. The user SHALL be able to cancel an active turn without deleting its completed history, and transport failure SHALL preserve the draft until acceptance is known.

The surface SHALL name the agent it is talking to, taking that name from what the agent reports rather than from fixed copy. Text presented to the user SHALL NOT assume a particular agent, so that installing a different agent changes the name shown and nothing else.

The way of working a prompt runs under SHALL be presented as a **mode** — the agent's own named ways of working, such as building or planning. It SHALL NOT be called an agent, because that word names the program Chat talks to.

A control the surface offers the user to start an operation — a picker such as the mode or model chooser — SHALL be presented only when the agent declares the capability behind it. Where that capability is undeclared, the control SHALL be absent rather than shown inert, shown empty, or shown with an error. Reactive interaction controls — those that appear only in response to an agent-raised request, governed by "Users can resolve agent interaction requests in context" — are not covered here: an agent that lacks a capability raises no request of that kind, so the control has nothing to appear for. Absence of a capability SHALL NOT degrade any capability the agent does declare.

#### Scenario: Empty prompt is not submitted
- **WHEN** the composer contains only whitespace
- **THEN** the send action is unavailable and no mutation is sent

#### Scenario: Follow-up steers a running turn
- **WHEN** the user submits another prompt while the selected OpenCode conversation is running and steering is available
- **THEN** the prompt is associated with the active turn and the UI identifies it as a steer

#### Scenario: Cancellation preserves completed content
- **WHEN** the user cancels a running turn
- **THEN** OpenCode is asked to abort that turn
- **AND** content and tool activity already received remain in the timeline with an interrupted outcome

#### Scenario: The surface names its agent
- **WHEN** a conversation is open and the agent has reported its identity
- **THEN** the surface names that agent
- **AND** no user-visible text names a different agent

#### Scenario: Ways of working are presented as modes
- **WHEN** the agent offers more than one way of working, such as building and planning
- **THEN** the user selects between them as modes
- **AND** they are not labelled agents

#### Scenario: An undeclared proactive control leaves nothing behind
- **WHEN** the agent does not declare the capability behind a control the surface offers the user to start an operation, such as a mode or model picker
- **THEN** that control is absent from the surface
- **AND** the controls for declared capabilities are unaffected
