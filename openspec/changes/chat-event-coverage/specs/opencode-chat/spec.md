## MODIFIED Requirements

### Requirement: Conversation updates are structured and reconnectable
The server SHALL normalize OpenCode activity into ordered conversation events covering user and assistant content, reasoning, tool lifecycle, permission requests and resolutions, structured questions and resolutions, context compaction, reverted work, turn status, cancellation, completion, warnings, and errors. Normalization SHALL recognize each of these regardless of which of OpenCode's event-naming generations announced it, and when one logical occurrence is announced more than once the timeline SHALL contain a single entry for it.

An event the server does not recognize, or whose payload it cannot parse, SHALL be skipped without ending or restarting the event stream, and SHALL be counted by type so an operator can discover what a running workspace is discarding. Counting MUST NOT record event payloads.

A history snapshot SHALL identify a stream cursor; reconnecting from a retained cursor SHALL replay every later event in order before delivering live events. If the cursor is no longer replayable or belongs to an earlier server generation, the server SHALL explicitly require a fresh snapshot. Applying a snapshot followed by its event stream MUST NOT duplicate message content or tool entries.

#### Scenario: Stream reconnect replays missed output
- **WHEN** the event connection drops during an assistant response and reconnects with a retained cursor
- **THEN** every event after that cursor is replayed once in order before live output continues

#### Scenario: Stale cursor requests resynchronization
- **WHEN** a client reconnects with a cursor outside retained history or from an earlier workspace-server generation
- **THEN** the stream reports that a new snapshot is required rather than silently omitting events

#### Scenario: Cumulative and incremental provider updates do not duplicate text
- **WHEN** OpenCode reports overlapping cumulative part state and text deltas for one assistant part
- **THEN** the normalized timeline contains each text segment exactly once

#### Scenario: An interaction announced under either naming generation is recognized
- **WHEN** OpenCode announces a permission request or a structured question using either its current or its legacy event name
- **THEN** the request appears in the conversation that raised it and can be answered

#### Scenario: One occurrence announced twice yields one entry
- **WHEN** a single permission request or question reaches the server under both naming generations
- **THEN** the conversation shows one entry for it
- **AND** answering it sends exactly one response to OpenCode

#### Scenario: An unrecognized event does not end the stream
- **WHEN** OpenCode emits an event type the server does not handle
- **THEN** the event is skipped, the stream continues delivering later events, and the occurrence is counted by type

#### Scenario: An unparseable event costs one event, not the stream
- **WHEN** an event of a recognized type carries a payload the server cannot parse
- **THEN** only that event is dropped and counted
- **AND** subsequent events for that conversation are still delivered

#### Scenario: Discarded-event counts are observable
- **WHEN** an operator inspects the workspace's diagnostic counters after events were discarded
- **THEN** the counts are reported per event type
- **AND** no event payload is included

#### Scenario: A compacted conversation says so
- **WHEN** OpenCode compacts a conversation's context
- **THEN** the timeline records that compaction occurred rather than appearing to lose content without explanation

#### Scenario: Reverted work stops being presented as current
- **WHEN** OpenCode reports that work in a conversation was reverted
- **THEN** the timeline reflects the revert rather than continuing to present the reverted work as though it still applies

### Requirement: Users can resolve agent interaction requests in context
An unresolved OpenCode permission request SHALL appear in the conversation that raised it with the available one-time approval, session approval, and rejection choices supported by OpenCode. A structured OpenCode question SHALL render its prompt, options, multi-selection behavior, and free-form response when supported. A resolved request SHALL become non-interactive and record its outcome. Only the active unresolved request MAY accept a response, and submitting a response more than once MUST NOT produce multiple provider replies.

A pending request SHALL remain discoverable and answerable even when the server did not observe its live announcement — because the event stream was interrupted, restarted, or the conversation was not being tracked at the time. Loading a conversation SHALL reconcile its unresolved requests against OpenCode's own pending set, so a request that OpenCode is still waiting on is never permanently invisible.

#### Scenario: Permission is approved once
- **WHEN** OpenCode requests permission for a command and the user chooses one-time approval
- **THEN** the response is sent once to the matching pending request
- **AND** the card records that the request was approved for that occurrence

#### Scenario: User rejects a structured question
- **WHEN** OpenCode asks a structured question and the user rejects or dismisses it
- **THEN** OpenCode receives one rejection response
- **AND** the resolved card can no longer submit an answer

#### Scenario: Stale request response is refused
- **WHEN** a client attempts to answer a request that is already resolved or no longer active
- **THEN** the server rejects it without forwarding another response to OpenCode

#### Scenario: A request missed by the event stream is recovered on load
- **WHEN** OpenCode raised a permission request while the server's event stream was interrupted, and the user then opens that conversation
- **THEN** the pending request appears and can be answered
- **AND** answering it resolves the request OpenCode is waiting on

#### Scenario: Recovered and live announcements do not double up
- **WHEN** a pending request is recovered on load and OpenCode also announces it over the event stream
- **THEN** the conversation shows one entry for that request

#### Scenario: Reconciliation failure preserves what is already shown
- **WHEN** the server cannot read OpenCode's pending set while loading a conversation
- **THEN** requests already known to the conversation remain visible and answerable
