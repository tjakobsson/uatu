## MODIFIED Requirements

### Requirement: Users can resolve agent interaction requests in context
An unresolved OpenCode permission request SHALL appear in the conversation that raised it with the approval and rejection choices OpenCode supports for it: approving the single occurrence, approving persistently, and rejecting. Where a permission would change a file, the request SHALL show what it would change — the pending diff — where the choice is made, so the user sees the change before allowing it. A permission with nothing to show a diff for is unaffected. A structured OpenCode question SHALL render its prompt, options, multi-selection behavior, and free-form response when supported. A resolved request SHALL become non-interactive and record its outcome. A resolved request SHALL also recede: its outcome stays legible where the request was raised, but it MUST NOT keep the footprint it held while it needed an answer, and what it named SHALL stay reachable from the receded form. Submitting a response more than once MUST NOT produce multiple provider replies.

A request raised by a subagent SHALL additionally appear in the conversation that launched that subagent, and SHALL be answerable there. The subagent's own conversation remains the single owner of the request: an answer given from the launching conversation SHALL be directed to the owning conversation, so exactly one response reaches OpenCode however many places the request was shown. Resolving it SHALL resolve it everywhere it appears.

Only the active unresolved request of a given conversation MAY accept a response. Where requests from more than one conversation are shown together, they SHALL each be governed by the conversation that owns them, so a request awaiting a user in one conversation does not block answering a request owned by another.

A request's state SHALL be distinguishable without reading its body — whether it awaits the user now, awaits its turn behind another request of the same conversation, or is resolved. That distinction MUST NOT rely on colour alone. A request awaiting its turn MUST NOT be presented as obsolete, superseded, or otherwise not needing an answer, because it will require one.

The surface SHALL report how many requests are outstanding across everything it is showing, and SHALL offer a way to reach an outstanding request without hunting for it.

A choice that grants authority beyond the request being answered SHALL state the scope and lifetime of that authority where the choice is offered, so a user learns what they are granting before granting it rather than afterwards. In particular, OpenCode's persistent approval carries past the answered request into later conversations served by the same OpenCode instance and covers the request's saved pattern rather than only the resource displayed, and it is lost when that instance restarts. It MUST NOT be presented as limited to the current conversation, nor as outliving the OpenCode instance that granted it.

A pending request SHALL remain discoverable and answerable even when the server did not observe its live announcement — because the event stream was interrupted, restarted, or the conversation was not being tracked at the time. Loading a conversation SHALL reconcile its unresolved requests against OpenCode's own pending set, so a request that OpenCode is still waiting on is never permanently invisible.

#### Scenario: Permission is approved once
- **WHEN** OpenCode requests permission for a command and the user chooses one-time approval
- **THEN** the response is sent once to the matching pending request
- **AND** the card records that the request was approved for that occurrence

#### Scenario: An edit permission shows its diff before approval
- **WHEN** a pending permission would change a file
- **THEN** the card shows the change it would apply
- **AND** the diff is shown where the approve and reject choices are

#### Scenario: A non-edit permission shows no diff
- **WHEN** a pending permission has no file change to show
- **THEN** the card presents its choices without a diff

#### Scenario: An answered request recedes
- **WHEN** a permission or question has been answered
- **THEN** what was asked and what was decided remain legible
- **AND** the request occupies less of the transcript than it did while it needed an answer
- **AND** the resources it named remain reachable from it

#### Scenario: A subagent's request reaches the conversation that launched it
- **WHEN** a subagent raises a permission request while its parent conversation is open
- **THEN** the request appears in the parent conversation
- **AND** it is answerable there without first opening the subagent's transcript

#### Scenario: Answering a subagent's request from the parent replies once
- **WHEN** the user answers a subagent's request from the parent conversation
- **THEN** OpenCode receives exactly one response, for the subagent's conversation
- **AND** the request shows as resolved in both the parent and the subagent's transcript

#### Scenario: Requests owned by different conversations do not block each other
- **WHEN** a parent conversation has its own pending request and a subagent's pending request is shown alongside it
- **THEN** both are answerable
- **AND** answering one does not change whether the other can be answered

#### Scenario: A request needing an answer is distinguishable at a glance
- **WHEN** a conversation shows requests that need an answer, requests awaiting their turn, and resolved requests
- **THEN** each state is distinguishable without reading the card body
- **AND** the distinction is carried by something other than colour alone

#### Scenario: A queued request is not described as obsolete
- **WHEN** a pending request is not yet answerable because another request of the same conversation is active
- **THEN** it is presented as awaiting its turn
- **AND** it is not presented as superseded, obsolete, or resolved

#### Scenario: Outstanding requests are counted and reachable
- **WHEN** one or more requests are outstanding in what the surface is showing
- **THEN** the surface reports how many are outstanding
- **AND** offers a way to reach an outstanding request directly
- **AND** reports none once every request has been answered

#### Scenario: User rejects a structured question
- **WHEN** OpenCode asks a structured question and the user rejects or dismisses it
- **THEN** OpenCode receives one rejection response
- **AND** the resolved card can no longer submit an answer

#### Scenario: Stale request response is refused
- **WHEN** a client attempts to answer a request that is already resolved or no longer active
- **THEN** the server rejects it without forwarding another response to OpenCode

#### Scenario: Persistent approval states the authority it grants
- **WHEN** a permission request offers the persistent approval choice
- **THEN** the surface states that choosing it reaches beyond this conversation and beyond this exact request, and that it lasts until OpenCode restarts
- **AND** it is not described as applying only to this conversation, nor as permanent

#### Scenario: Persistent approval is still sent as OpenCode's persistent reply
- **WHEN** the user chooses persistent approval
- **THEN** OpenCode receives its persistent-approval reply once for that request
- **AND** the recorded outcome is unchanged from before this correction

#### Scenario: A request missed by the event stream is recovered on load
- **WHEN** OpenCode raised a permission request while the server's event stream was interrupted, and the user then opens that conversation
- **THEN** the pending request appears and can be answered
- **AND** answering it resolves the request OpenCode is waiting on

#### Scenario: Recovered and live announcements do not double up
- **WHEN** a pending request is recovered on load and OpenCode also announces it over the event stream
- **THEN** the conversation shows one entry for that request

#### Scenario: Reconciliation failure preserves what is already shown
- **WHEN** the server cannot read OpenCode's pending set while loading a conversation
- **THEN** requests already known to the conversation remain visible and answerable
