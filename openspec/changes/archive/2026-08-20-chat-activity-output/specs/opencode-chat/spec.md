## MODIFIED Requirements

### Requirement: Chat presents turns as readable conversation with inspectable activity
The web Chat surface SHALL render user prompts and streamed assistant Markdown as the primary conversation, with safe code rendering consistent with UatuCode's existing rendering posture. Reasoning, tool calls, command execution, file changes, and tool results SHALL be represented as subordinate, inspectable activity with running, completed, failed, and cancelled states rather than flattened into assistant prose. While a tool runs, its output SHALL be shown as it streams rather than only on completion, so a long-running tool shows progress. A finished tool's output SHALL be bounded — presented as a summary and a bounded preview with a way to see the rest — rather than shown whole or hidden whole. Untrusted Markdown, tool output, filenames, and errors MUST NOT create active markup or script execution.

#### Scenario: Assistant answer remains visually primary
- **WHEN** a turn contains assistant text interleaved with multiple tool calls
- **THEN** the answer reads as a coherent conversation
- **AND** tool activity can be expanded for detail without being mistaken for assistant prose

#### Scenario: Streaming tool lifecycle updates in place
- **WHEN** a tool moves from running to completed or failed
- **THEN** its existing activity entry updates state instead of adding a duplicate entry

#### Scenario: A running tool shows its output as it streams
- **WHEN** a tool is running and the agent streams its output
- **THEN** the surface shows that output as it arrives
- **AND** it updates the tool's existing entry in place

#### Scenario: A finished tool's output is bounded with a way to see the rest
- **WHEN** a completed tool produced more output than the bounded preview shows
- **THEN** the entry shows a summary and a bounded preview
- **AND** offers a way to see the full output
- **AND** does not render the whole output by default

#### Scenario: Hostile content remains inert
- **WHEN** assistant Markdown or tool output contains script-capable markup or a JavaScript URL
- **THEN** the rendered conversation does not execute it or expose an active unsafe link
