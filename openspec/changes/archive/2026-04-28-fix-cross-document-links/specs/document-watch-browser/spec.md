## ADDED Requirements

### Requirement: Navigate cross-document anchor clicks inside the preview
When a user clicks an anchor inside the rendered preview whose resolved URL maps to a known non-binary document under any watched root, the browser UI SHALL switch the preview to that document via the in-app document load path rather than letting the browser perform a full navigation. The interception MUST resolve the click target against the per-document `<base href>` so cross-document references written as relative paths (e.g. `xref:other.adoc[…]`, `[setup](guides/setup.md)`) reach the correct document. The interception MUST NOT fire for any of the following — those clicks MUST fall through to the browser's default behavior: a fragment-only href (handled by the existing in-page anchor handler), a modifier-click (Cmd, Ctrl, Shift, or Alt held), an explicit `target` attribute other than `_self`, a URL whose origin differs from the current page, a non-`http(s):` protocol (`mailto:`, `javascript:`, `tel:`, etc.), a path that does not resolve to any document in the current state, and a path that resolves to a document classified as binary. After the in-app load completes, a fragment in the resolved URL (e.g. `other.adoc#section`) SHALL scroll the matching element into view, mirroring sanitize's `user-content-` id prefix the same way the in-page anchor handler does.

#### Scenario: Clicking an AsciiDoc cross-document link swaps the preview in place
- **WHEN** a user clicks an anchor in an AsciiDoc preview whose `href` is `asciidoc-cheatsheet.adoc`
- **AND** that file is a known non-binary document under a watched root
- **THEN** the preview swaps to render `asciidoc-cheatsheet.adoc`
- **AND** the page URL pathname does not change (the SPA shell stays in place)
- **AND** the browser does NOT request `/asciidoc-cheatsheet.adoc` from the static-file fallback
- **AND** the sidebar selection follows the new document

#### Scenario: Clicking a Markdown cross-document link swaps the preview in place
- **WHEN** a user clicks an anchor in a Markdown preview whose `href` is `guides/setup.md`
- **AND** that file is a known non-binary document under a watched root
- **THEN** the preview swaps to render `guides/setup.md`
- **AND** the sidebar selection follows the new document

#### Scenario: A subdirectory cross-document link still swaps the preview
- **WHEN** a user clicks an anchor whose `href` resolves through the per-document `<base href>` to a non-binary document inside a subdirectory of a watched root
- **THEN** the preview swaps to render that document
- **AND** the page URL pathname does not change

#### Scenario: An external link is not intercepted
- **WHEN** a user clicks an anchor whose `href` origin differs from the current page (e.g. `https://example.com`)
- **THEN** the click is NOT intercepted and the browser navigates to the external URL natively

#### Scenario: A modifier-click is not intercepted
- **WHEN** a user holds Cmd, Ctrl, Shift, or Alt and clicks a cross-document anchor
- **THEN** the click is NOT intercepted and the browser handles it natively (typically opening the resolved URL in a new tab)

#### Scenario: A link to a binary document is not intercepted
- **WHEN** a user clicks an anchor whose `href` resolves to a document classified as binary under a watched root
- **THEN** the click is NOT intercepted and the browser fetches the URL through the static-file fallback

#### Scenario: A fragment-only link is left to the in-page anchor handler
- **WHEN** a user clicks an anchor whose `href` begins with `#`
- **THEN** the cross-document handler does NOT intercept and the existing in-page anchor handler scrolls the matching id into view inside the current document

## MODIFIED Requirements

### Requirement: Render AsciiDoc in light mode
The preview pane SHALL render AsciiDoc files (`.adoc`, `.asciidoc`) using `@asciidoctor/core` configured with the `secure` safe mode. The system MUST NOT classify `.asc` files as AsciiDoc (despite GitHub doing so) because that extension is dominantly used for PGP ASCII-armored signatures and keys. The rendered HTML SHALL be sanitized against the same GitHub-modeled allowlist used for Markdown rendering, extended to whitelist the structural classes needed to style admonitions and callouts (`admonitionblock`, `note`, `tip`, `important`, `caution`, `warning`, `listingblock`, `title`, `content`, `colist`, `conum`). The preview MUST support GitHub-aligned AsciiDoc rendering for at minimum: section titles at every depth (the level-0 doctitle as `<h1>` and `==`–`======` mapping to `<h2>`–`<h6>`), paragraphs, ordered and unordered lists, tables, bold and italic, footnotes (collected at the bottom of the document), admonition blocks (`NOTE`, `TIP`, `IMPORTANT`, `CAUTION`, `WARNING`), `[source,LANG]` listings, table-of-contents output when the `:toc:` document attribute is set, and in-document cross-references via `<<id>>`. In-page anchor `href`s in the rendered HTML MUST resolve to the (possibly sanitize-prefixed) heading `id`s of the same document so that clicking a TOC entry or `<<xref>>` actually navigates to the target. **Cross-document AsciiDoc references — `xref:other.adoc[…]`, `xref:other.adoc#section[…]`, and the `<<other.adoc#section,…>>` shorthand — MUST keep their original file extension in the rendered `href` so the in-app cross-document anchor handler can resolve them against the watched roots; the system MUST NOT rewrite `.adoc` (or `.asciidoc`) to `.html` (this is enforced by setting the Asciidoctor `relfilesuffix` document attribute to `.adoc`).** The preview MUST NOT honor `include::` directives (the `secure` safe mode silently drops them), MUST NOT execute `<script>`/`<iframe>` or other active-content elements, MUST strip inline event handler attributes, and MUST reject `javascript:` URLs — matching the existing Markdown sanitize posture. The preview MUST default to light-mode visual presentation, reusing the existing GitHub-style document styling for elements common to both formats and applying minimal additional styling for AsciiDoc-specific structures (admonitions, callouts, listing block titles). For AsciiDoc input at or above 1 MB the preview MUST bypass Asciidoctor entirely and render the file as plain escaped text inside `<pre><code class="hljs">`, parallel to the existing size threshold for non-Markdown code views.

#### Scenario: A cross-document `xref:` keeps the `.adoc` extension
- **WHEN** an AsciiDoc document contains `xref:other.adoc[Other]`
- **THEN** the rendered `<a>` element carries `href="other.adoc"`
- **AND** the rendered href does NOT contain `.html`

#### Scenario: A cross-document `<<other.adoc#section,…>>` shorthand keeps the `.adoc` extension
- **WHEN** an AsciiDoc document contains `<<other.adoc#section,Other>>`
- **THEN** the rendered `<a>` element carries `href="other.adoc#section"`
- **AND** the rendered href does NOT contain `.html`
