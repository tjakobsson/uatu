## ADDED Requirements

### Requirement: Navigate cross-document anchor clicks inside the preview
When a user clicks an anchor inside the rendered preview whose resolved URL maps to a known non-binary document under any watched root, the browser UI SHALL switch the preview to that document via the in-app document load path rather than letting the browser perform a full navigation. The interception MUST resolve the click target against the per-document `<base href>` so cross-document references written as relative paths (e.g. `xref:other.adoc[…]`, `[setup](guides/setup.md)`) reach the correct document. The interception MUST NOT fire for any of the following — those clicks MUST fall through to the browser's default behavior: a fragment-only href (handled by the existing in-page anchor handler), a modifier-click (Cmd, Ctrl, Shift, or Alt held), an explicit `target` attribute other than `_self`, a URL whose origin differs from the current page, a non-`http(s):` protocol (`mailto:`, `javascript:`, `tel:`, etc.), a path that does not resolve to any document in the current state, and a path that resolves to a document classified as binary. After the in-app load completes, a fragment in the resolved URL (e.g. `other.adoc#section`) SHALL scroll the matching element into view, mirroring sanitize's `user-content-` id prefix the same way the in-page anchor handler does. When the interception fires AND the active document is changing as a result of the click, the system MUST push a new browser history entry via `history.pushState`, with the new URL being the target document's relative path (per-segment percent-encoded), so the back button can return to the previously selected document.

#### Scenario: Clicking an AsciiDoc cross-document link swaps the preview in place
- **WHEN** a user clicks an anchor in an AsciiDoc preview whose `href` is `asciidoc-cheatsheet.adoc`
- **AND** that file is a known non-binary document under a watched root
- **THEN** the preview swaps to render `asciidoc-cheatsheet.adoc`
- **AND** the page URL pathname updates to `/asciidoc-cheatsheet.adoc`
- **AND** a new history entry is pushed
- **AND** the browser does NOT request `/asciidoc-cheatsheet.adoc` from the static-file fallback as a sub-resource fetch
- **AND** the sidebar selection follows the new document

#### Scenario: Clicking a Markdown cross-document link swaps the preview in place
- **WHEN** a user clicks an anchor in a Markdown preview whose `href` is `guides/setup.md`
- **AND** that file is a known non-binary document under a watched root
- **THEN** the preview swaps to render `guides/setup.md`
- **AND** the page URL pathname updates to `/guides/setup.md`
- **AND** a new history entry is pushed
- **AND** the sidebar selection follows the new document

#### Scenario: A subdirectory cross-document link still swaps the preview
- **WHEN** a user clicks an anchor whose `href` resolves through the per-document `<base href>` to a non-binary document inside a subdirectory of a watched root
- **THEN** the preview swaps to render that document
- **AND** the page URL pathname updates to that document's relative path

#### Scenario: An external link is not intercepted
- **WHEN** a user clicks an anchor whose `href` origin differs from the current page (e.g. `https://example.com`)
- **THEN** the click is NOT intercepted and the browser navigates to the external URL natively

#### Scenario: A modifier-click is not intercepted
- **WHEN** a user holds Cmd, Ctrl, Shift, or Alt and clicks a cross-document anchor
- **THEN** the click is NOT intercepted and the browser handles it natively (typically opening the resolved URL in a new tab)

#### Scenario: A link to a binary document is not intercepted
- **WHEN** a user clicks an anchor whose `href` resolves to a document classified as binary under a watched root
- **THEN** the click is NOT intercepted and the browser fetches the URL through the static-file fallback

#### Scenario: A fragment-only link is left to the in-page anchor handler
- **WHEN** a user clicks an anchor whose `href` begins with `#`
- **THEN** the cross-document handler does NOT intercept and the existing in-page anchor handler scrolls the matching id into view inside the current document

#### Scenario: An oversized AsciiDoc file falls back to plain text
- **WHEN** a user selects an `.adoc` file at or above 1 MB
- **THEN** the preview renders the contents inside `<pre><code class="hljs">` as plain escaped text
- **AND** Asciidoctor is not invoked on the contents

### Requirement: Reflect the active document in the URL
The browser URL pathname SHALL track the document currently rendered in the preview, at all times during a watch session. User-initiated changes to the active document (sidebar tree click, in-preview cross-document link click, manual pin/unpin that changes the rendered file) MUST push a new entry onto the browser history stack via `history.pushState`, with the new URL being the document's relative path (per-segment percent-encoded). Follow-mode auto-switches caused by file-system events MUST update the URL via `history.replaceState` so the address bar stays accurate without polluting the back stack with file-change-driven entries. On initial page load, the system MUST call `history.replaceState` once to populate `history.state` with the current document identifier so subsequent `popstate` events can be resolved unambiguously. The system MUST NOT update the URL while the active document is unchanged.

#### Scenario: Clicking a sidebar entry pushes a history entry
- **WHEN** a user clicks a non-binary document in the sidebar tree
- **THEN** the browser URL pathname updates to the clicked document's relative path
- **AND** a new entry is added to the browser history stack
- **AND** clicking the browser back button restores the previously selected document

#### Scenario: Clicking a cross-document link in the preview pushes a history entry
- **WHEN** a user clicks an anchor in the preview whose href resolves to a known non-binary document under a watched root
- **THEN** the browser URL pathname updates to that document's relative path
- **AND** a new entry is added to the browser history stack

#### Scenario: Follow-mode auto-switch replaces the URL without pushing
- **WHEN** follow mode is enabled and a file-system change causes the active document to switch
- **THEN** the browser URL pathname updates to the new document's relative path
- **AND** no new entry is added to the browser history stack
- **AND** clicking the browser back button does NOT step backward through the chain of follow-driven switches

#### Scenario: Path segments are percent-encoded
- **WHEN** the active document's relative path contains characters that require encoding (e.g. spaces, unicode, `#`, `?`)
- **THEN** each path segment in the URL is percent-encoded via `encodeURIComponent`
- **AND** the URL remains parseable and round-trips back to the original relative path on decode

### Requirement: Open a document by direct URL
The browser UI SHALL initialize on the document identified by `location.pathname` when the SPA boots. When `location.pathname` is `/`, the system MUST select the server-provided default document (today's behavior). When `location.pathname` resolves to a known non-binary document under a watched root, the system MUST select that document as the initial active preview, overriding the server-provided `defaultDocumentId`. When `location.pathname` resolves to a document that exists under a watched root but is outside the current scope (for example, the session is pinned to a different file), the SPA MUST render an empty-preview state explaining that the session is pinned to another file rather than silently selecting the wrong document or auto-unpinning. When `location.pathname` does not resolve to any known document under any watched root, the server MUST return a 404 via the static-file fallback (the SPA shell is not served — see "Serve adjacent files from watched roots as static content"); the SPA's "document not found" empty-preview state instead handles in-session cases where a previously-known document becomes unresolvable, covered under "Navigate document history with the browser back and forward buttons". When `location.hash` is present, the system MUST scroll the matching element into view after the document loads, mirroring the existing in-page anchor handler's `user-content-` prefix logic.

#### Scenario: Navigating directly to a document URL renders that document
- **WHEN** a user navigates the browser to `http://127.0.0.1:NNNN/guides/setup.md` (typed URL, bookmark, or shared link)
- **AND** `guides/setup.md` is a known non-binary document under a watched root
- **THEN** the SPA boots with `guides/setup.md` as the active preview
- **AND** the rendered preview is the Markdown rendering of `guides/setup.md`, not its raw source bytes
- **AND** the sidebar selection follows the active document

#### Scenario: Refreshing the page restores the active document
- **WHEN** a user has navigated to a document and the URL pathname reflects it
- **AND** the user refreshes the page
- **THEN** the SPA boots and renders the same document as before the refresh
- **AND** the sidebar selection matches

#### Scenario: A direct link to a document includes a fragment
- **WHEN** a user navigates to `http://127.0.0.1:NNNN/guides/setup.md#installation`
- **AND** the document contains a heading whose sanitized id is `user-content-installation`
- **THEN** the document loads
- **AND** the page scrolls to the matching heading after render

#### Scenario: A direct link to an unknown path returns 404
- **WHEN** a user navigates the browser to a path that does not resolve to any document under a watched root
- **THEN** the server responds with 404 via the static-file fallback
- **AND** the SPA shell is NOT served (no empty-preview state for unresolvable paths on direct-link arrival — see design D4)

#### Scenario: A direct link to a document outside the pinned scope is rejected
- **WHEN** the watch session is pinned to file `README.md`
- **AND** a user navigates to `http://127.0.0.1:NNNN/guides/setup.md`
- **THEN** the SPA renders an empty-preview state explaining the session is pinned to `README.md`
- **AND** the active preview is NOT switched to `guides/setup.md`
- **AND** the sidebar still shows only the pinned file

### Requirement: Force follow mode off when arriving via a direct document URL
When the SPA boots with `location.pathname` resolving to a known non-binary document (i.e. anything other than `/`), the system MUST disable follow mode for the session, regardless of the server-provided `initialFollow` value derived from the CLI flags. The follow toggle MUST reflect the disabled state. The user MAY re-enable follow mode after arrival via the existing follow toggle. When `location.pathname` is `/`, the system MUST honor the server-provided `initialFollow` value (today's behavior preserved).

#### Scenario: Direct link arrival turns follow mode off
- **WHEN** a user navigates directly to `http://127.0.0.1:NNNN/guides/setup.md`
- **AND** the CLI was started without `--no-follow` (so the server's `initialFollow` is `true`)
- **THEN** the SPA boots with follow mode disabled
- **AND** the follow toggle's pressed state is `false`

#### Scenario: Default-URL arrival honors the CLI follow default
- **WHEN** a user navigates to `http://127.0.0.1:NNNN/`
- **AND** the CLI was started without `--no-follow`
- **THEN** the SPA boots with follow mode enabled

#### Scenario: User can re-enable follow after a direct-link arrival
- **WHEN** the SPA has booted via a direct link with follow mode disabled
- **AND** the user clicks the follow toggle
- **THEN** follow mode becomes enabled
- **AND** the active preview catches up to the latest changed non-binary file under the watched roots

### Requirement: Navigate document history with the browser back and forward buttons
The system SHALL handle the browser's `popstate` event by re-selecting the document identified by the new URL pathname, without itself pushing or replacing additional history entries. The newly active document MUST be loaded through the in-app document load path (no full-page navigation). When the URL pathname resolves to a document outside the current scope or to no known document, the system MUST apply the same empty-preview rules defined in "Open a document by direct URL". When `popstate` fires AND follow mode is currently enabled, the system MUST disable follow mode for the session so the next file-system change does not immediately undo the back/forward navigation; this mirrors the follow-off rule that already applies to sidebar clicks, cross-document link clicks, and direct-link arrival.

#### Scenario: Back button restores a previously selected document
- **WHEN** a user has navigated from `README.md` to `guides/setup.md` to `guides/troubleshooting.md` via in-app clicks
- **AND** the user clicks the browser back button
- **THEN** the active preview returns to `guides/setup.md`
- **AND** the sidebar selection matches

#### Scenario: Forward button restores a document the user just stepped back from
- **WHEN** a user has stepped back from `guides/troubleshooting.md` to `guides/setup.md`
- **AND** the user clicks the browser forward button
- **THEN** the active preview returns to `guides/troubleshooting.md`

#### Scenario: Popstate to a no-longer-existent document renders empty preview
- **WHEN** a history entry refers to a document that has since been deleted from disk
- **AND** the user navigates to that entry via back/forward
- **THEN** the SPA renders an empty-preview state with a "document not found" message
- **AND** the sidebar still functions

#### Scenario: Browser back disables follow mode
- **WHEN** follow mode is enabled
- **AND** the user clicks the browser back button
- **THEN** the active preview returns to the previous document
- **AND** follow mode is disabled
- **AND** a subsequent file-system change does NOT auto-switch the preview away from the back-navigated document until the user re-enables follow

### Requirement: Navigate Git Log commit previews by URL
The browser UI SHALL represent Git Log commit previews with a same-origin URL using the query parameters `repository` and `commit` on the SPA root path. A commit preview URL MUST resolve against the bounded repository commit-log data already present in the current state payload. The browser UI MUST restore a resolvable commit preview on direct-link arrival, refresh, and `popstate`. When the URL references a repository or commit that is not present in the current bounded state payload, the browser UI MUST render a clear empty-preview unavailable state instead of selecting an unrelated document.

#### Scenario: Direct commit preview URL renders the commit message
- **WHEN** a user navigates directly to `/?repository=<repositoryId>&commit=<commitSha>`
- **AND** the current state payload contains that repository and commit in its bounded commit log
- **THEN** the SPA boots with that commit message rendered in the main preview
- **AND** no document is selected in the file tree
- **AND** Follow mode is disabled

#### Scenario: Refreshing a commit preview URL restores the commit preview
- **WHEN** a user has opened a commit preview whose URL contains `repository` and `commit` query parameters
- **AND** the user refreshes the page
- **THEN** the SPA boots and renders the same commit preview again
- **AND** the URL remains the commit preview URL

#### Scenario: Back button restores the previous preview from a commit preview
- **WHEN** a user opens a document preview
- **AND** the user opens a commit preview from the Git Log
- **AND** the user clicks the browser back button
- **THEN** the active preview returns to the previous document
- **AND** the sidebar selection matches that document

#### Scenario: Forward button restores a commit preview
- **WHEN** a user has stepped back from a commit preview to a document preview
- **AND** the user clicks the browser forward button
- **THEN** the active preview returns to the commit preview
- **AND** no document is selected in the file tree

#### Scenario: Commit preview URL references unavailable data
- **WHEN** a user navigates to a commit preview URL whose repository or commit is not present in the current bounded state payload
- **THEN** the SPA renders an empty-preview state explaining that the commit preview is unavailable
- **AND** the sidebar remains usable

#### Scenario: Active commit preview is re-resolved after state refresh
- **WHEN** the active preview is a commit preview
- **AND** the browser receives a refreshed state payload
- **THEN** the browser re-resolves the active repository and commit against the refreshed payload
- **AND** the preview renders the refreshed commit data when the commit is still present
- **AND** the preview renders an unavailable empty state when the commit is no longer present
