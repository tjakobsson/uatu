# opencode-chat Specification

## Purpose
Define workspace-scoped OpenCode conversations and the responsive web chat surface through which authenticated users can inspect, direct, interrupt, and resume coding-agent work.

## Requirements

### Requirement: Chat uses the workspace's OpenCode installation and identity
When chat is first needed in a running workspace, UatuCode SHALL discover the `opencode` executable available to that workspace process and start a loopback-only OpenCode service whose lifetime is owned by the workspace server. The service SHALL use OpenCode's existing user configuration and authentication; UatuCode MUST NOT request, copy, persist, or transmit provider API keys. If OpenCode is unavailable, cannot start, or is not authenticated, the workspace and all non-chat capabilities SHALL remain usable and the Chat surface SHALL report an actionable unavailable state.

Startup SHALL be observed as two separately bounded phases, distinguished by whether OpenCode has answered at the protocol level rather than by any text it emits. Until a probe receives an HTTP response, the generous bind budget applies; from the first HTTP response onward, a shorter health budget applies. A startup that fails SHALL be attributed to the phase that failed: if no probe ever received an HTTP response, the failure SHALL report that OpenCode never accepted a health request at the probed endpoint; if any probe did, the failure SHALL report that OpenCode answered but never became healthy, naming the endpoint and the last status observed. A health probe SHALL be individually bounded so that a connection which is accepted but never answered does not consume the whole budget.

UatuCode MUST NOT depend on the format of any text OpenCode writes to its standard output or standard error in order to determine readiness. Such output MAY be captured as diagnostic evidence, but a change to its format MUST NOT affect whether Chat becomes ready.

#### Scenario: Existing OpenCode authentication is reused
- **WHEN** the workspace user has already authenticated OpenCode and opens Chat
- **THEN** UatuCode connects using that existing OpenCode identity without asking for a provider API key

#### Scenario: OpenCode is not installed
- **WHEN** the workspace cannot resolve an OpenCode executable
- **THEN** Chat explains that OpenCode must be installed and authenticated
- **AND** document preview, search, and terminal capabilities continue working

#### Scenario: Workspace shutdown owns the agent service
- **WHEN** the workspace server shuts down while its OpenCode service is running
- **THEN** the OpenCode service and any active turn it owns are terminated before workspace shutdown completes
- **AND** persisted OpenCode conversation history remains available for a later workspace start

#### Scenario: OpenCode never accepts a health request
- **WHEN** OpenCode is spawned and stays alive but every probe is refused before the bind budget elapses
- **THEN** Chat reports an unavailable state attributed to the bind phase
- **AND** the reported message distinguishes this from a health-check failure

#### Scenario: OpenCode answers but never becomes healthy
- **WHEN** a probe receives an HTTP response and no subsequent probe reports a healthy body before the health budget elapses
- **THEN** Chat reports an unavailable state attributed to the health phase
- **AND** the reported message identifies the probed endpoint and the last status observed

#### Scenario: An answering-but-unhealthy server fails on the short budget
- **WHEN** OpenCode answers the first probe immediately and then answers every probe with a non-healthy response
- **THEN** Chat reports unavailable after the health budget rather than after the full startup budget

#### Scenario: Readiness does not depend on emitted text
- **WHEN** OpenCode becomes healthy at the probed endpoint but writes nothing recognizable to its standard output
- **THEN** Chat becomes ready

#### Scenario: A single unanswered probe does not exhaust the budget
- **WHEN** a probe connects to the endpoint and the connection is accepted but never answered
- **THEN** that probe is abandoned before the budget elapses
- **AND** further probes are attempted while the budget remains

### Requirement: A failed Chat startup reports actionable diagnostics
When Chat becomes unavailable because OpenCode could not be started or could not become healthy, the reported unavailable state SHALL carry the evidence needed to diagnose the failure from the report alone, without asking the user to reproduce it. That evidence SHALL include the resolved `opencode` executable path, any other executables of that name that were passed over on the search path, the OpenCode version when it could be determined, the endpoint that was probed, the elapsed time and number of probes attempted, the concrete outcome of the last probe, and bounded captures of OpenCode's standard output and standard error.

The diagnostics MUST NOT contain the ephemeral OpenCode server password, in any field or capture, in any encoding. Captures SHALL be bounded so a verbose or looping OpenCode cannot grow the workspace process's memory without limit.

#### Scenario: A timed-out startup names its own evidence
- **WHEN** OpenCode fails to become ready and Chat reports unavailable
- **THEN** the reported state includes the resolved executable path, the probed endpoint, the elapsed time, and the last probe's concrete outcome
- **AND** a user can attach that report to a bug report without running any further commands

#### Scenario: The last probe outcome distinguishes failure kinds
- **WHEN** the last health probe failed
- **THEN** the reported outcome distinguishes a refused connection from an abandoned unanswered connection from an HTTP status response from a malformed or unhealthy body
- **AND** an HTTP status response reports the status code

#### Scenario: An unrecognized probe failure is not misattributed
- **WHEN** a probe fails in a way that matches none of the known outcome kinds
- **THEN** the outcome is recorded as unknown along with the underlying error
- **AND** it is not counted as a refused connection

#### Scenario: Shadowed executables on the search path are reported
- **WHEN** more than one `opencode` executable is present on the workspace process's search path
- **THEN** the diagnostics report the one that was chosen and the ones that were passed over

#### Scenario: The server password never appears in diagnostics
- **WHEN** any unavailable state carrying diagnostics is produced
- **THEN** no field or capture contains the ephemeral OpenCode server password

#### Scenario: Captured output is bounded
- **WHEN** OpenCode writes more output than the capture limit before failing
- **THEN** the diagnostics retain a bounded portion of that output rather than all of it

### Requirement: The Chat startup budget is operator-overridable
The workspace SHALL accept an environment variable `UATU_OPENCODE_STARTUP_TIMEOUT_MS` that overrides the default Chat startup budget for that workspace process. An absent, empty, non-numeric, or non-positive value SHALL leave the default in effect rather than failing workspace startup, because Chat is not required for the workspace to be usable. The default budget SHALL be generous enough to tolerate a cold OpenCode start on a slow filesystem.

#### Scenario: An operator widens the budget without a new build
- **WHEN** a workspace process runs with `UATU_OPENCODE_STARTUP_TIMEOUT_MS` set to a larger value than the default
- **THEN** Chat startup waits up to that value before reporting unavailable

#### Scenario: The override reaches a hub-hosted workspace
- **WHEN** the hub runs with `UATU_OPENCODE_STARTUP_TIMEOUT_MS` set and starts a session for a workspace
- **THEN** that session's Chat startup uses the overridden budget

#### Scenario: An invalid override is ignored
- **WHEN** a workspace process runs with `UATU_OPENCODE_STARTUP_TIMEOUT_MS` set to an empty, non-numeric, or non-positive value
- **THEN** the default budget is used
- **AND** the workspace starts normally

### Requirement: A failed Chat startup can be retried without restarting the workspace
A Chat startup failure SHALL NOT be permanent for the life of the workspace process. The Chat surface SHALL offer a user-initiated retry whenever it is unavailable for a startup reason, and that retry SHALL discard the cached failure and attempt startup again. Retry SHALL be user-initiated rather than automatic, so that a slow start is not multiplied by unattended attempts. A retry already in flight SHALL NOT start a second concurrent OpenCode process.

#### Scenario: A user recovers after fixing their environment
- **WHEN** Chat is unavailable because OpenCode failed to start, the user corrects the cause, and the user triggers retry
- **THEN** Chat attempts startup again and becomes ready without the workspace being restarted

#### Scenario: A retry that fails reports fresh diagnostics
- **WHEN** a user triggers retry and startup fails again
- **THEN** Chat reports the unavailable state with diagnostics from the new attempt, not the previous one

#### Scenario: Installation guidance leads when OpenCode is absent
- **WHEN** Chat is unavailable because no `opencode` executable could be resolved
- **THEN** the surface leads with the instruction to install OpenCode rather than presenting retry as the remedy
- **AND** retry remains available as a secondary action, because the workspace caches the unavailable state and a completed installation must be discoverable without restarting the workspace

#### Scenario: Concurrent retries are joined
- **WHEN** a retry is in flight and another retry is triggered
- **THEN** the second retry joins the in-flight attempt
- **AND** only one OpenCode process is started

### Requirement: Every conversation is confined to the server-selected workspace directory
The chat backend SHALL select the workspace's canonical first watch root as the OpenCode working directory and SHALL use that directory for conversation discovery, creation, history, prompts, and tools. Browser requests MUST NOT provide or override a filesystem working directory. Before exposing or resuming an OpenCode session, UatuCode SHALL verify that the session's canonical directory matches the selected workspace directory; a session belonging to another directory MUST NOT be exposed, resumed, or mutated through that workspace.

#### Scenario: Hub workspace fixes the working directory
- **WHEN** a user opens Chat under `/s/project-a/`
- **THEN** every newly created OpenCode conversation runs in the canonical registered path for `project-a`
- **AND** no request field can redirect it to another folder

#### Scenario: Multi-root direct serve has a deterministic chat root
- **WHEN** a direct UatuCode workspace watches more than one root
- **THEN** Chat uses the canonical first watch root, matching the embedded terminal's working-directory rule

#### Scenario: Foreign session identifier is rejected
- **WHEN** a client supplies an OpenCode session identifier whose canonical directory belongs to another workspace
- **THEN** the server rejects the operation without revealing that conversation's content or metadata

### Requirement: Users can discover, create, resume, and inspect workspace conversations
The authenticated workspace API SHALL list resumable OpenCode conversations associated with the selected workspace directory, create a new conversation, and return paginated normalized history for a selected conversation. Conversation identity and durable provider history SHALL remain owned by OpenCode; UatuCode SHALL retain only the provider identifiers and presentation state needed to reconnect and render them. Restarting UatuCode or its workspace-scoped OpenCode service MUST NOT by itself erase completed conversation history.

#### Scenario: Existing workspace conversation appears after restart
- **WHEN** an OpenCode conversation has completed turns in a workspace and the UatuCode workspace restarts
- **THEN** the conversation appears in the Chat inventory and can be resumed with its prior history

#### Scenario: New conversation starts empty
- **WHEN** the user creates a conversation from Chat
- **THEN** OpenCode creates it in the selected workspace directory
- **AND** the client receives its server-issued identity and an empty initial timeline

#### Scenario: Older history is paginated
- **WHEN** a conversation has more history than the initial page limit
- **THEN** the client can request older items with an opaque server-issued cursor
- **AND** items are not duplicated or reordered across adjacent pages

### Requirement: The workspace API exposes normalized chat operations
The workspace API SHALL provide authenticated operations to list, create, and read conversations; start a prompt turn; cancel the active turn; answer a pending permission; and answer or reject a structured question. Mutation requests SHALL be origin-protected under cookie authentication, SHALL validate conversation ownership against the workspace directory, and SHALL use client-generated request identifiers to make network retries idempotent. Provider-specific payloads and credentials MUST NOT be exposed as the public contract when a normalized UatuCode representation exists.

#### Scenario: Retried prompt does not run twice
- **WHEN** a client retries a prompt mutation with the same request identifier after losing the response
- **THEN** the server returns the original accepted result or current outcome
- **AND** OpenCode receives the prompt at most once

#### Scenario: Cross-origin mutation is rejected
- **WHEN** a cookie-authenticated cross-origin request attempts to prompt, cancel, or answer an agent request
- **THEN** the workspace rejects it without changing the conversation

#### Scenario: Base-path deployment uses relocated chat routes
- **WHEN** Chat is served under a workspace base path such as `/s/project-a/`
- **THEN** every chat request and stream URL resolves through that base path
- **AND** the hub proxies it without exposing the loopback OpenCode service

### Requirement: Conversation updates are structured and reconnectable
The server SHALL normalize OpenCode activity into ordered conversation events covering user and assistant content, reasoning, tool lifecycle, permission requests and resolutions, structured questions and resolutions, context compaction, reverted work, turn status, cancellation, completion, warnings, and errors. Normalization SHALL recognize each of these regardless of which of OpenCode's event-naming generations announced it, and when one logical occurrence is announced more than once the timeline SHALL contain a single entry for it.

An event the server does not recognize, or whose payload it cannot parse, SHALL be skipped without ending or restarting the event stream, and SHALL be counted by type so an operator can discover what a running workspace is discarding. Counting MUST NOT record event payloads.

A history snapshot SHALL identify a stream cursor; reconnecting from a retained cursor SHALL replay every later event in order before delivering live events. If the cursor is no longer replayable or belongs to an earlier server generation, the server SHALL explicitly require a fresh snapshot. Applying a snapshot followed by its event stream MUST NOT duplicate message content or tool entries.

#### Scenario: Stream reconnect replays missed output
- **WHEN** the event connection drops during an assistant response and reconnects with a retained cursor
- **THEN** every event after that cursor is replayed once in order before live output continues

#### Scenario: Stale cursor requests resynchronization
- **WHEN** a client reconnects with a cursor outside retained history or from an earlier workspace-server generation
- **THEN** the stream reports that a new snapshot is required rather than silently omitting events

#### Scenario: Cumulative and incremental provider updates do not duplicate text
- **WHEN** OpenCode reports overlapping cumulative part state and text deltas for one assistant part
- **THEN** the normalized timeline contains each text segment exactly once

#### Scenario: An interaction announced under either naming generation is recognized
- **WHEN** OpenCode announces a permission request or a structured question using either its current or its legacy event name
- **THEN** the request appears in the conversation that raised it and can be answered

#### Scenario: One occurrence announced twice yields one entry
- **WHEN** a single permission request or question reaches the server under both naming generations
- **THEN** the conversation shows one entry for it
- **AND** answering it sends exactly one response to OpenCode

#### Scenario: An unrecognized event does not end the stream
- **WHEN** OpenCode emits an event type the server does not handle
- **THEN** the event is skipped, the stream continues delivering later events, and the occurrence is counted by type

#### Scenario: An unparseable event costs one event, not the stream
- **WHEN** an event of a recognized type carries a payload the server cannot parse
- **THEN** only that event is dropped and counted
- **AND** subsequent events for that conversation are still delivered

#### Scenario: Discarded-event counts are observable
- **WHEN** an operator inspects the workspace's diagnostic counters after events were discarded
- **THEN** the counts are reported per event type
- **AND** no event payload is included

#### Scenario: A compacted conversation says so
- **WHEN** OpenCode compacts a conversation's context
- **THEN** the timeline records that compaction occurred rather than appearing to lose content without explanation

#### Scenario: Reverted work stops being presented as current
- **WHEN** OpenCode reports that work in a conversation was reverted
- **THEN** the timeline reflects the revert rather than continuing to present the reverted work as though it still applies

### Requirement: Chat presents turns as readable conversation with inspectable activity
The web Chat surface SHALL render user prompts and streamed assistant Markdown as the primary conversation, with safe code rendering consistent with UatuCode's existing rendering posture. Reasoning, tool calls, command execution, file changes, and tool results SHALL be represented as subordinate, inspectable activity with running, completed, failed, and cancelled states rather than flattened into assistant prose. Untrusted Markdown, tool output, filenames, and errors MUST NOT create active markup or script execution.

#### Scenario: Assistant answer remains visually primary
- **WHEN** a turn contains assistant text interleaved with multiple tool calls
- **THEN** the answer reads as a coherent conversation
- **AND** tool activity can be expanded for detail without being mistaken for assistant prose

#### Scenario: Streaming tool lifecycle updates in place
- **WHEN** a tool moves from running to completed or failed
- **THEN** its existing activity entry updates state instead of adding a duplicate entry

#### Scenario: Hostile content remains inert
- **WHEN** assistant Markdown or tool output contains script-capable markup or a JavaScript URL
- **THEN** the rendered conversation does not execute it or expose an active unsafe link

### Requirement: Users can resolve agent interaction requests in context
An unresolved OpenCode permission request SHALL appear in the conversation that raised it with the approval and rejection choices OpenCode supports for it: approving the single occurrence, approving persistently, and rejecting. A structured OpenCode question SHALL render its prompt, options, multi-selection behavior, and free-form response when supported. A resolved request SHALL become non-interactive and record its outcome. Submitting a response more than once MUST NOT produce multiple provider replies.

A request raised by a subagent SHALL additionally appear in the conversation that launched that subagent, and SHALL be answerable there. The subagent's own conversation remains the single owner of the request: an answer given from the launching conversation SHALL be directed to the owning conversation, so exactly one response reaches OpenCode however many places the request was shown. Resolving it SHALL resolve it everywhere it appears.

Only the active unresolved request of a given conversation MAY accept a response. Where requests from more than one conversation are shown together, they SHALL each be governed by the conversation that owns them, so a request awaiting a user in one conversation does not block answering a request owned by another.

A request's state SHALL be distinguishable without reading its body — whether it awaits the user now, awaits its turn behind another request of the same conversation, or is resolved. That distinction MUST NOT rely on colour alone. A request awaiting its turn MUST NOT be presented as obsolete, superseded, or otherwise not needing an answer, because it will require one.

The surface SHALL report how many requests are outstanding across everything it is showing, and SHALL offer a way to reach an outstanding request without hunting for it.

A choice that grants authority beyond the request being answered SHALL state the scope and lifetime of that authority where the choice is offered, so a user learns what they are granting before granting it rather than afterwards. In particular, OpenCode's persistent approval carries past the answered request into later conversations served by the same OpenCode instance and covers the request's saved pattern rather than only the resource displayed, and it is lost when that instance restarts. It MUST NOT be presented as limited to the current conversation, nor as outliving the OpenCode instance that granted it.

A pending request SHALL remain discoverable and answerable even when the server did not observe its live announcement — because the event stream was interrupted, restarted, or the conversation was not being tracked at the time. Loading a conversation SHALL reconcile its unresolved requests against OpenCode's own pending set, so a request that OpenCode is still waiting on is never permanently invisible.

#### Scenario: Permission is approved once
- **WHEN** OpenCode requests permission for a command and the user chooses one-time approval
- **THEN** the response is sent once to the matching pending request
- **AND** the card records that the request was approved for that occurrence

#### Scenario: A subagent's request reaches the conversation that launched it
- **WHEN** a subagent raises a permission request while its parent conversation is open
- **THEN** the request appears in the parent conversation
- **AND** it is answerable there without first opening the subagent's transcript

#### Scenario: Answering a subagent's request from the parent replies once
- **WHEN** the user answers a subagent's request from the parent conversation
- **THEN** OpenCode receives exactly one response, for the subagent's conversation
- **AND** the request shows as resolved in both the parent and the subagent's transcript

#### Scenario: Requests owned by different conversations do not block each other
- **WHEN** a parent conversation has its own pending request and a subagent's pending request is shown alongside it
- **THEN** both are answerable
- **AND** answering one does not change whether the other can be answered

#### Scenario: A request needing an answer is distinguishable at a glance
- **WHEN** a conversation shows requests that need an answer, requests awaiting their turn, and resolved requests
- **THEN** each state is distinguishable without reading the card body
- **AND** the distinction is carried by something other than colour alone

#### Scenario: A queued request is not described as obsolete
- **WHEN** a pending request is not yet answerable because another request of the same conversation is active
- **THEN** it is presented as awaiting its turn
- **AND** it is not presented as superseded, obsolete, or resolved

#### Scenario: Outstanding requests are counted and reachable
- **WHEN** one or more requests are outstanding in what the surface is showing
- **THEN** the surface reports how many are outstanding
- **AND** offers a way to reach an outstanding request directly
- **AND** reports none once every request has been answered

#### Scenario: User rejects a structured question
- **WHEN** OpenCode asks a structured question and the user rejects or dismisses it
- **THEN** OpenCode receives one rejection response
- **AND** the resolved card can no longer submit an answer

#### Scenario: Stale request response is refused
- **WHEN** a client attempts to answer a request that is already resolved or no longer active
- **THEN** the server rejects it without forwarding another response to OpenCode

#### Scenario: Persistent approval states the authority it grants
- **WHEN** a permission request offers the persistent approval choice
- **THEN** the surface states that choosing it reaches beyond this conversation and beyond this exact request, and that it lasts until OpenCode restarts
- **AND** it is not described as applying only to this conversation, nor as permanent

#### Scenario: Persistent approval is still sent as OpenCode's persistent reply
- **WHEN** the user chooses persistent approval
- **THEN** OpenCode receives its persistent-approval reply once for that request
- **AND** the recorded outcome is unchanged from before this correction

#### Scenario: A request missed by the event stream is recovered on load
- **WHEN** OpenCode raised a permission request while the server's event stream was interrupted, and the user then opens that conversation
- **THEN** the pending request appears and can be answered
- **AND** answering it resolves the request OpenCode is waiting on

#### Scenario: Recovered and live announcements do not double up
- **WHEN** a pending request is recovered on load and OpenCode also announces it over the event stream
- **THEN** the conversation shows one entry for that request

#### Scenario: Reconciliation failure preserves what is already shown
- **WHEN** the server cannot read OpenCode's pending set while loading a conversation
- **THEN** requests already known to the conversation remain visible and answerable

### Requirement: Users can prompt, steer, and cancel the active conversation
The Chat composer SHALL submit non-empty text to the selected conversation and clearly distinguish ready, sending, running, interrupted, and failed states. While OpenCode supports steering a running session, a subsequent submitted prompt SHALL be presented as a steer of the active turn rather than an unrelated concurrent turn. The user SHALL be able to cancel an active turn without deleting its completed history, and transport failure SHALL preserve the draft until acceptance is known.

#### Scenario: Empty prompt is not submitted
- **WHEN** the composer contains only whitespace
- **THEN** the send action is unavailable and no mutation is sent

#### Scenario: Follow-up steers a running turn
- **WHEN** the user submits another prompt while the selected OpenCode conversation is running and steering is available
- **THEN** the prompt is associated with the active turn and the UI identifies it as a steer

#### Scenario: Cancellation preserves completed content
- **WHEN** the user cancels a running turn
- **THEN** OpenCode is asked to abort that turn
- **AND** content and tool activity already received remain in the timeline with an interrupted outcome

### Requirement: Timeline position remains stable under streaming and navigation
The Chat timeline SHALL remain pinned to the latest content only while the user is at or near its end. Once the user scrolls away, streaming, tool updates, image or code layout, and activity expansion MUST NOT steal the reading position; an accessible latest-content affordance SHALL indicate unseen updates and return to the end. Prepending older history SHALL preserve the same visible content and offset. Opening a conversation SHALL restore that client's last reading position when possible, otherwise it SHALL open at the latest turn.

#### Scenario: Active reader follows streaming output
- **WHEN** the user is at the end of the timeline as assistant content streams
- **THEN** new content remains visible without repeated manual scrolling

#### Scenario: Reading older content is not interrupted
- **WHEN** the user scrolls above the end while content continues streaming
- **THEN** their visible content remains anchored
- **AND** an affordance reports and navigates to unseen latest content

#### Scenario: Loading older history preserves the viewport
- **WHEN** the user requests an older history page at the top of the loaded timeline
- **THEN** the previously visible first item remains at the same visual offset after insertion

#### Scenario: Expanding activity does not cause an unrelated jump
- **WHEN** the user expands or collapses a tool entry away from the timeline end
- **THEN** the chosen entry remains anchored in the viewport

### Requirement: Desktop presents Preview and Chat as a persistent split
In desktop mode the work area SHALL present Preview and Chat side by side with
a draggable divider between them; Chat SHALL NOT be movable or dockable. The
split position SHALL be persisted as a fraction of the work-area width so
window resizing preserves the proportion, and it SHALL be restored across
reloads. A collapsed Chat SHALL render as a slim strip at the work area's
right edge carrying a visible reopen affordance, and expanding SHALL restore
the retained fraction. When the viewport is too narrow to present both
surfaces at their minimum usable widths, Chat SHALL auto-collapse with its
open preference preserved and SHALL be restored when the viewport grows.
Chat panel state MUST NOT alter the terminal's dock, sizing, visibility, or
persistence behavior: a bottom-docked terminal SHALL span beneath both
Preview and Chat, and a right-docked terminal SHALL keep the work area's
right edge, with Chat between Preview and the terminal.

#### Scenario: Split proportion survives reload and resize
- **WHEN** a desktop user drags the divider to a new position, resizes the
  window, and reloads the page
- **THEN** Preview and Chat retain their fractional share of the work area
  throughout, subject to each surface's minimum width

#### Scenario: Collapsed panel reopens at its prior share
- **WHEN** the user collapses Chat and later activates the strip's reopen
  affordance
- **THEN** Chat expands to the fraction it had before collapsing

#### Scenario: Narrow viewport yields to Preview
- **WHEN** the viewport shrinks below the width needed for both surfaces and
  later grows past it again
- **THEN** Chat auto-collapses while Preview remains usable
- **AND** Chat reopens automatically because the open preference was preserved

#### Scenario: Right-docked terminal keeps the right edge
- **WHEN** the terminal is docked right and Chat is open
- **THEN** the terminal occupies the work area's right edge exactly as it does
  with Chat collapsed
- **AND** Chat sits between Preview and the terminal

#### Scenario: Revealing chat content expands a collapsed panel
- **WHEN** an action that presents Chat content (such as find-in-chat) targets
  a collapsed panel
- **THEN** the panel expands to its retained fraction rather than acting on an
  invisible surface

### Requirement: Chat adapts to the desktop split, touch, and software-keyboard viewports
In desktop mode Preview and Chat SHALL be co-visible primary surfaces sharing
the main work area alongside the existing sidebar and independently dockable
terminal; there SHALL NOT be a mode that replaces Preview with Chat.
Collapsing, expanding, or resizing the Chat panel MUST NOT remount either
surface or lose its state. In touch mode Chat SHALL occupy its own
full-screen tab surface. The composer SHALL remain reachable above the visual
viewport and safe-area inset while the software keyboard is present, and
keyboard opening, resizing, or dismissal MUST NOT hide the input or cause the
current reading position to jump.

#### Scenario: Preview updates while the conversation stays visible
- **WHEN** a desktop user prompts the agent and it modifies the currently
  previewed document
- **THEN** the live preview updates while the conversation, its streaming
  output, and the composer remain visible

#### Scenario: Desktop collapse and reopen preserves both surfaces
- **WHEN** a desktop user collapses the Chat panel and reopens it
- **THEN** the same conversation, draft, loaded history, and reading position
  are retained
- **AND** the Preview document and scroll position are unchanged
- **AND** terminal attachment and visibility are unchanged

#### Scenario: iPhone keyboard keeps composer visible
- **WHEN** a touch user focuses the Chat composer and the software keyboard
  reduces the visual viewport
- **THEN** the composer remains fully visible above the keyboard and bottom
  safe area
- **AND** the timeline resizes without placing the active content behind the
  composer

### Requirement: Conversation file references navigate through UatuCode safely
Workspace-relative file references in assistant content or normalized
file-change activity SHALL offer navigation to the corresponding UatuCode
document preview when the target is within the watched roots. Activating such
a reference SHALL open the document in Preview and reveal the referenced line
when supplied; in desktop mode this MUST NOT hide, collapse, or resize the
Chat panel, and in touch mode it SHALL switch to the Preview tab. Absolute
paths outside the watched roots, traversal attempts, and unresolved targets
MUST NOT be exposed as navigable workspace links.

#### Scenario: Assistant references a watched source line
- **WHEN** assistant content references `src/app.ts:42` and that file is in the watched workspace
- **THEN** activating the reference opens that document in Preview at line 42
- **AND** in desktop mode the conversation remains visible beside it

#### Scenario: Outside path is not navigable
- **WHEN** provider output references an absolute path outside every watched root or contains traversal outside the workspace
- **THEN** Chat renders it as inert text rather than a UatuCode navigation action
